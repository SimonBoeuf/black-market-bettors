# Black Market Brawlers : Riot API Challenge 2.0 entry

Category: Black Market Brawlers

## Introduction
Black Market Bettors is a small game that will challenge your analysis capabilities :
- The server is permanently running replays-like of black market brawlers games. Your aim is to guess which team will win : When you connect to the server, you will be able to guess which team will win as soon as a game is running
- Throughout the game, you will see the evolution of gold/objectives/players stuffs/brawlers/... per team. If you think you chose the wrong team, change it ! Your final score will be calculated depending on the time spent with your bet placed on the right team.
- When the game is over, you will see a screen displaying the winning team as well as your final score, which is : time spent on the winning team / game duration * 1000 (x1000 a score is always prettier)
- Wait 10 seconds, and another game will be loaded. Have fun !

## Demo

## How it works
- The first time a client connects to the server, a game Singleton is initialized. For every new connection, a websocket will be opened between server and client
- The singleton will first chose a random game, then get its timeline using the API. Please not that every piece of data except for images are stored in databased and reused instead of calling API again.
- Once the game data is ready, the replay will start, sending sockets for every event to every client
- When client bets on a team, it will start a timer, which will end either when the client changes team, or when game finishes.
- At the end of the game, score of each client is computed and sent to the corresponding client.
- Server will then sleep for ten seconds before reinitializing singleton.

## Setting it up
### Prerequisites
    Postgresql (tested with 9.3.9)
    Ruby 2.1.2
    Rails 4.1.6
### Configuration and launch
- Rename the file config/riot_api.yml.sample to config/riot_api.yml and place your api_key in it
- You can set the game speed in config/initializers/game.rb (default: 10, which means game will last ten times shorter than it actually did)
- Build a valid [database.yml](https://gist.github.com/erichurst/961978). file, which you will place in config/ folder as well
-   ``bundle install``
-   ``rake db:create``
-   ``rake db:migrate``
-   ``rails s``

### Notes
- It might take a while to load games the first few times you launch the server, because you will have to request api for every single static data. Don't worry, it will get better.
- There is a little problem with item sets at the moment. Don't be surprised if you happen to see multiple times the same tier 3 item on a player, it's just a ~~bug~~ feature
